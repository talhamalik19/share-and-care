# Share-and-Care

## Introduction

A multi-platform solution that provides hospitals and users (public) an easy way to communicate among themselves. The system enables hospitals and users to share resources. Hospitals can also post requests for volunteers for which users can apply and in response some of them would be selected by the respective hospitals. This system consists of a React (web app for hospitals) developed using Bootstrap and React Native (mobile app for users) with Express as backend and MongoDB as database.
